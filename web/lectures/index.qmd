# Lectures and Quizzes

Lecture content is delivered by videos.
Each week you will be expected to watch a set of videos and then take a multiple-choice quiz on the material.
Links to the videos, quizzes and supplemental material are provided below.
The slides for the two whole-class meetings are also provided.

Note that in weeks 6 and 7, the order of Lectures/quiz/Lab are not the same for everyone. Odd numbered teams are in Group A and Even numbered teams are in Group B.
Please make sure prelab is done for the correct lab.

Quizzes are due at noon (12 p.m.) on Mondays on Gradescope during the semester.
The specific due dates for each group are listed below.

- [Introduction to E80 Robot Software](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iZiWU3SrHjz8JaDDIr9f0q_rbZuiqgIt)
- [Electrical and Mechanical Modifications for the Project](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15Fxa2cCJTmTctiDUJQCwhMFjNa4Zfk8-)

You may notice that a lot of these previous topics are focused on Fourier Series and Transforms, those are important concepts that we expect you to pick up in E72.
If you'd like to brush up on them you can take a look at these videos:

- [Khan Academy on Fourier Series](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering/ee-signals#ee-fourier-series) (this is a sin/cos formulation rather than complex exponential, but it's a good introduction.  The visualization video is particularly helpful.)
- [David Dorran on the Discrete Fourier Transform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6QJLx22zrE) (a quick introduction to thinking about this for sampled data with a link to a longer video at the end)
- [We have some prototype Fourier Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDA3QBjykWVxmUZvHMy7Qc9i1rltPq9IV) (there are more topics we'd like to cover, but these are an OK place to start)
