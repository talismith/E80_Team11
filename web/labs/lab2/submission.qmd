## Section 1: What is one 'Teensy Unit'? 

i.e.: How much has the Voltage input to the Teensy changed when the number reported by matlablogging.m increases by 1?  Include a graph of Teensy output vs. sample number, any other relevant measurement setup information or measurements, and calculations showing how you did your conversion from measured units to Teensy units.

Effort Specification:

- [ ] Includes a graph of data sampled from the Teensy
- [ ] Includes information (an oscilloscope measurement, a multimeter measurement, or a detail of how the function generator is set up) that can be used to calibrate the vertical scale of the Teensy graph.
- [ ] Some calculations present

Complete Specification:

- [ ] One sentence describing what happens to Teensy outputs when Teensy inputs are less than zero
- [ ] One sentence explaining what point or points were used to calculate the Teensy unit.
- [ ] Calculations are correct and yield the proper Teensy unit value.

## Sections 5: Fill in this table

Fill in only one of the "Measured Output Voltage" columns for each measurement, whichever is appropriate to the instrument that you are using to measure.  If you are using the "Measured Output Voltage (Vpp)" column, then also convert that measured voltage to an RMS value in the Converted Output Voltage (Vrms) column.

| Z1 & Z2 | Instrument | Predicted Output Voltage (Vrms) | Measured Output Voltage (Vrms) | Measured Output Voltage (Vpp) | Covnerted Output Voltage (Vrms) | Predicted Uncertainty Bounds (%) | Difference from Theory (%) |

| Z1=wire, Z2=open | Multimeter | | | | | | |
| Z1=wire, Z2=open | 1x Scope Probe | | | | | | |
| Z1=wire, Z2=open | 10x Scope Probe | | | | | | |
| Z1=wire, Z2=open | Teensy | | | | | | |
| Z1=10 $\Omega$, Z2=20 $\Omega$ | Multimeter | | | | | | | 
| Z1=10 $\Omega$, Z2=20 $\Omega$ | Teensy | | | | | | | 
| Z1=1 k$\Omega$, Z2=2 k$\Omega$ | Multimeter | | | | | | | 
| Z1=1 k$\Omega$, Z2=2 k$\Omega$ | Teensy | | | | | | | 
| Z1=100 k$\Omega$, Z2=200 k$\Omega$ | Multimeter | | | | | | |

Effort Specification:
1. At least half of the measurements are filled in with plausible values.
2. Measured values also have a corresponding predicted value that shows understanding of the divider equation.

Complete Specification:
1. All measurements are filled in with correct values
2. Theoretical calculations correctly include loading effects and match measurements well. (i.e.: Predicted Output Voltage (Vrms) and Measured/Converted Output Voltage (Vrms) are within predicted error bounds of one another.)
